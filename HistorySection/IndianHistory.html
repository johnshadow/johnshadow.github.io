<h1>North Indian History From The Turn of The Century</h1>
<h2>25BCE - 100CE</h2>

<hr>
<h1>Part 1 Religions</h1>
<p>
<p>Religions in India were diverse and many different culture melding together in one area. Due to this there's much diversity to go over ranging from Native Tamil gods to Vedic gods and even Greek gods. Although this text will be focusing mainly on Vedic Hindiusm, and the local gods of the time due to them being the most popular and reported amongst all people groups in India.</p>

<hr>
<h2>Hinduism</h2>
<p>Hinduism is a cover terms for the many different religions of India, some of these are later religions focusing on gods who weren't as prominate in Vedic religion. It's said by some that much of later Hinduism is an alagum of different Indian cultures with Brahmanical orthopraxy, and not having a direct single founder. This alagum state happened sometime after the Nastika schools became popular in India over taking vedic tradition. This change happened around 300BC to 200AD during the second urbanization period, and the early classical period of Hinduism, when the Epics and the first Purānas were composed. It flourished after the medievel period when buddhism and other Nastika religions started to fall out of favour.</p>

<p>Prominent themes in Hindu beliefs include the four Puruṣārthas, the proper goals or aims of human life; namely, dharma (ethics/duties), artha (prosperity/work), kama (desires/passions) and moksha (liberation/freedom from the passions and the cycle of death and rebirth), as well as karma (action, intent and consequences) and saṃsāra (cycle of death and rebirth). Hinduism prescribes the eternal duties, such as honesty, refraining from injuring living beings (Ahiṃsā), patience, forbearance, self-restraint, virtue, and compassion, among others. Some of these ideals overlap with other Nastika religions like Buddhism and Jainism.</p>
<h3>Gods and DemiGods</h3>
<h4>Samkarshana (संकर्षण) </h4>
<p>The Cult of Vasudeva and Samkarshana was one of the significant independent cults. In epic and Puranic lore, Samkarshana was also known by: Balarama, Rama, Baladeva, Rauhineya, or Halayudha. Later known as Balarama, he was a son of Vasudeva. He is presented as the elder brother of Vasudeva.</p>
<h4>Vasudeva-Krishna (वसुदेव) </h4>
<p>This name references that Krishna is of Vasudeva, as Vasudeva is Krishna's father. He was a leading member of the Vrishni heroes and may well have been a historical ruler in the region of Mathura. Followers called themselves Bhagavatas from Mathura's original religious culture. Eventually was later assimilated with Narayan. "ॐ नमो भगवते वासुदेवाय" Is a popular mantra in modern India.</p>
<h4>Pradyumna (प्रद्युम्न) </h4>
<p>He is the eldest son of the Hindu deities Krishna and Rukmini. The Harivamsa describes intricate relationships between the Vrishni heroes Krishna Vasudeva, Sankarsana, Pradyumna, and Aniruddha, which would later form a Vaishnava concept of primary quadrupled expansion, or avatar.</p>
<h4>Samba (संब) </h4>
<p>He was the son of the Hindu god Krishna and his second consort, Jambavati. His actions, caused by anger, brought an end to the Yadu dynasty.</p>
<h4>Aniruddha (अनिरुद्ध) </h4>
<p>Meaning "unrestrained, without obstacles, or unstoppable" was the son of Pradyumna and Rukmavati and the grandson of Krishna and Rukmini. He is said to have been very much like his grandfather, to the extent that he may be a Jana avatar, the avatar of Vishnu. The four are considered to be Vishnu-tattva or Vishnu's plenary expansions. It has also been used as one of the names of Lord Shiva.<>
<h4>Narasimha (नरसिंह) </h4>
<p>He is a fierce avatar of the Hindu god Vishnu. One who incarnates in the form of part lion and part man to destroy evil and end religious persecution and calamity on Earth. By doing so, he restores Dharma upon the Earth.</p>
<h4>Narayana (नारायण) </h4>
<p>Narayana is the one who is in yogic slumber under the celestial waters, referring to the masculine principle. He is also known as Purushottama and is considered the Supreme being in Vaishnavism.</p>
<h4>Garuda (गरुड़) </h4>
<p>He is a bird creature from Hindu mythology with eagle and human features. He's depicted in many Indo-Greek statues. The sunbird Garuda is the traditional vehicle of Vasudeva. Garuda, also referred to as Garula, are golden-winged birds in Buddhist texts which are Naga's enemies.</p>
<h4>Nagas (नाग) </h4>
<p>These are featured in Buddhist art as well Indo-Greek art and coins. They can have multiple heads and even take a human form. The Nagas are described as the powerful, splendid, wonderful, and proud semi-divine race that can assume their physical form as human, partial human-serpent, or the whole serpent.</p>
<h4>Shiva (शिव) </h4>
<p>This God first appears on a coin of Gondophares around 20BC and is often depicted riding a horse with a trident in hand. On the other side, he's usually standing, leaning slightly on his trident. (Pritchett)</p>

<p>These are just some of the common Gods that helped form the backbone for Modern Hinduism. Indologist Arvind Sharma suggested that the Gita was written later than the Mahabharata around the 2nd Century BC. In 113BC, a large temple HelioDorus of Taxila would help build and donate to a large temple complex nearby Mathura. Originally the temple complex had eight pillars; it's unknown what happened to the other eight. A quote of the Gita is found on this pillar, Lending to its age. Mentions of other temples of Vasudeva were found on a door jamb and stone slabs. The Naneghat inscription, from the first early century BC, mentions both Balarama (Samkarshana) and Vasudeva-Krishna, along with the Vedic deities: Indra, Surya, Chandra, Yama, Varuna, and Kubera. It shows the early association of Vedic tradition and Hinduism.</p>

<p>Their temples were a lot like modern-day temples mixed with Greco-Roman-Architecture. Often they were made out of brick, wood, mud, and other perishable materials. Some of the common themes were described in Jain and Buddist scripture (Kumar) (Thapar):</p>

<ul>
	<li>A raised platform with or without a symbol</li>
	<li>A raised platform under an umbrella</li>
	<li>A raised platform under a tree</li>
	<li>A raised platform is enclosed with a railing</li>
	<li>A raised platform inside a pillared pavilion</li>
</ul>

<p>Brahmans are part of the Vedic faith which is already an extension. Many of the Vedic Gods were present in other stories of Buddhism and Jainism. Mahesvara (Shiva), Sakra (Indra), Brahma, Sarasvati, Laksmi, Marici, and Hariti are depicted in Buddhist art. Vishnu was most likely a slightly later addition, but not necessarily. Coins depicting Shiva and Visnu were also found, confirming they existed and were worshiped. Often textual findings will also include some Sanskrit inscriptions, usually to Vasudeva Krsna. Ramayana was probably known and passed down over time being more of a play. Rama seldom gets references, be it in only a few inscriptions.</p>

<br>
<h3>Philosophies</h3>
<h4>Vaisheshika (वैशेषिक)</h4>
<p>The Vaisheshika system was founded by the sage Kanada, Uluka, Auluka, etc. It brings all objects of knowledge, i.e., the whole world, the seven categories of Substance (Dravya), quality (Guna), action (Karma), generality (Samanya), particularity (Vishesha), the relation of inherence (Samavaya), and non-existence (Abhava). There are nine kinds of substances: earth, water, fire, air, ether (Akasha), time, space, soul, and mind (manas). The first five are called physical elements (Bhutas) and have the specific qualities of smell, taste, color, touch, and sound, respectively. The first four are composed of the four kinds of atoms (earth, water, fire, air) which are invisible and indestructible particles of matter. The atoms are uncreated and eternal entities, and these are resolved any material object into smaller and smaller parts. Akasha, space, and time are invisible, eternal, and all-pervading, while the mind (manas) is an eternal substance that is not all-pervading but indefinitely small like an atom. The supreme creator or God is inferred as the creator of the world of effects. The atoms cannot move and act by themselves. The ultimate source of their actions is to be found in the will of God. Who directs their actions according to the law of karma. The atoms are made to compose a world that befits the unseen moral deserts (Adrishta) of individual souls and serves the purpose of moral dispensation. This is the atomic theory of Vaisheshikas. It is Teleological in nature.</p>
<p>A quality (Guna) is that which exists in a substance and has itself no quality or activity. There are altogether twenty-four kinds of qualities, viz., color, taste, smell, touch, sound, number, magnitude, distinctness (Prithaktva), conjunction (Samhyoga), disjunction (Vibhaga), remoteness (Paratva), nearness (Aparatva), fluidity (Dravatva), viscidity (Sneha), cognition (Buddhi), pleasure, pain, desire, aversion, striving (Prayatna), heaviness (Gurutva), tendency (Samskara), merit (Dharma), and demerit (Adharma).</p>
<p>An action (Karma) is a movement. There are five kinds of action, viz., throwing upward (Utskhepana), throwing downward (Avakshepana), contraction (Akuñcana), expansion (Prasarna), and going (Gamana).</p>
<p>One specific class of substances has a certain common nature and is thus excluded from other classes. This is called Gotva and is the Samanya in them. It is eternal. Therefore, a universal is the eternal essence common to all the individuals of a class.</p>
<p>Particularity (Vishesha) is the ground of the ultimate differences of things. There must be some ultimate difference or Peculiarity in each of them. Otherwise, they would not be different, having all the earth's qualities. Particularity stands for the peculiarity or individuality of the eternal entities of the world. It is special treatment of this category of Vishesha that explains 'Vaisheshika' given to this philosophy.</p>
<p>Inherence (Samavaya) is the permanent or eternal relation by which a whole is in its parts, a quality or an action is in a substance, the universal is in the particulars. This permanent relation between the whole and its parts, between the universal and its individuals, and between qualities or actions and their substances is known as Samavaya or Inherence.</p>
<p>Non-existence (Abhava) stands for all negative facts. All cases of non-existence are brought under the category of Abhava. It is of 4 kinds, namely, Pragabhava, Dhvamsabhava, Atyantabhava (these three things being put together under Sangsargabhava or the absence of one thing in another thing), and Anyonyabhava. The first one means the non-existence of a thing before (or prior to) its production. The second is the non-existence of a thing after its destruction (Dhvangsa). The third is the absence of a thing in another thing for all time - past, present, and future. When two things differ from each other, there is the non-existence of either as the other. This mutual non-existence of two different things is called Anyonyabhava.</p>

<h4>Nyaya (न्याय)</h4>
<p>Maharshi Gautama Akshapada was born in Mithila, modern-day Bihar, on the banks of the river Kshirodadhi. Over time, he came to settle in what is now known as Godna, a small village at the confluence of the Ganga and the Sarayu, and eventually retired to Kaṭhiyawar in Gujarat, on the Sea Coast. His time of living is understood to be contemporary to Jatukarna, a Vyasa of prominence in his day. This was approximated in 1913 to have been about 550 BC, about a century before Socrates of Athens. Maharshi Gautama began the study of Hetu Vidya, and with time he was utterly lost in the science. He would spend so much of his time reasoning that it is rumored that on one occasion, he was engrossed in his reason and logic as he walked, and in his absent-mindedness, he fell into a deep hole that had been dug in the ground.  There had then been much hassle in bringing him back out.</p>
<p>Over time, he formulated a set of rules of thought. Powered by these rules, the reasoning was finally brought into a systematic form, and it was possible for the first time for logicians to really discuss logic without being lost in dialogue and reasoning in circles and committing fallacies. These rules came to be known by an exceptional name - they came to be known as The Rules, or Nyaya. And the branch of logic that began with strict adherence to these rules of thought, which avoided fallacies and resolved confusion through systematic dialogue, became known as Tarka-Shastra or Vada-Shastra, the Study of Argument or the Study of Dialogue. This is essentially our word for logic.</p>
<p>Nyaya, as the more perceptive of my readers will notice, is also the name of the oldest orthodox school of Hinduism (i.e., the oldest Darshana). This is not a coincidence. Maharshi Gautama Akshapada is the founder of the Nyaya school, the very Darshana itself. And it was first standardized in his most valuable composition, the Nyayasutra.</p>
<p>The following characteristics constitute the good or honest debate:</p>

<ol>
	<li>The Establishment of the thesis and the counterargument should be based on adequate evidence (Pramana) and proper hypothetical or indirect reasoning (Tarka).</li>
	<li>The conclusion should not contradict any tenet or accepted doctrine (Siddhanta).</li>
	<li>Each side should use the  5 Steps of the Theory of Proper Argument to demonstrate their argument.</li>
	<li>There should recognize a thesis to be defended and a counterargument to be refuted.</li>
	<li>Steps from the Theory of Proper Argument</li>
</ol>
<ul>
	<li>Pratijna: the proposition or hypothesis</li>
	<li>Hetu: the reason</li>
	<li>Udaharana: the general rule (that which is independently confirmed or confirmable)</li>
	<li>Upanaya: the application of the rule (validity test, or example to the instance)</li>
	<li>Nigamana: the conclusion (the hypothesis is either true or false or in doubt)</li>
</ul>
<p>- Nyaya Sutra: 1.1.32 and 1.1.39</p>

<h4>Mimamsa (मीमांसा)</h4>

<p>In the field of epistemology, later Mimamsakas made some notable contributions. The Mimamsa Sutra or the Purva Mimamsa Sutras were written around 300-200 BC by Rishi Jaimini is one of the most important ancient Hindu philosophical texts. It forms the basis of Mimamsa, the earliest of the six orthodox schools (Darshanas) of Indian philosophy. It was used to construct Vedic Ritualism in a Philosophical mindset, which to help from being marginalized by Astika (Ajivika, Buddhist, Jain, etc). Unlike the Nyaya or the Vaisheshika systems, the Prabhakara sub-school of Mimamsa recognizes five means of valid knowledge (Pramana). </p>

<ul>
	<li>Pratyaksha: is one of the three principal means of knowledge, it means that which is present before the eyes clear, distinct, and evident.</li>
	<li>Pramana: literally means "proof" and "means of knowledge" and is described as reaching a new conclusion and truth from one or more observations and previous truths by applying reason.</li>
	<li>Upamana: means comparison and analogy, some Hindu schools consider it as a proper means of knowledge.</li>
	<li>Arthapatti: means postulation, derivation from circumstances, in contemporary logic, this.</li>
	<li>Pramana: is similar to circumstantial implication.</li>
	<li>Anupalabdi: accepted only by Kumarila Bhatta sub-school, means non-perception, negative/cognitive proof.</li>
	<li>Sabda: means relying on word, the testimony of past or present reliable experts, reliable expert testimony.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Buddhism</h2>

<p>To the extent that a deity was not essential to the creation and preservation of the universe, Buddhism was atheistic, arguing for a natural cosmic rise and decline. Originally a place of bliss, the world had been reduced to a place of suffering by human capitulation to desire. The authority of the Vedas was questioned, particularly as revealed texts associated with deity, and this was not specific only to Buddhism. Brahmanical ritual, especially the sacrificing of animals, was unacceptable. </p>
<p>Buddhism did not make caste a barrier to those who wished to be either Buddhist monks or lay followers. This was a contrast to Vedic Brahmanism, where caste was crucial to participation in, and sometimes even defined, various forms of worship. Buddhism was unable to negate caste as a form of stratification, which in later times, other non-caste religions such as Christianity and Islam also failed to do.</p>
<h3>Bharhut (भरहुत)</h3>

<p>A large temple complex was built and used around 125-100 BCE and is located in the Satna district of Madhya Pradesh, central India. This shows many Jatakas, stories from the previous lives of the Buddha. These stories follow Aesop's fables or Panchatantra of India.</p>

</ul>

<h3>Sanchi (साँची)</h3>
<p>Another significant temple complex has multiple stupas and temples. It was originally commissioned by the Mauryan emperor Ashoka the Great in the 3rd century BCE. In the 1st century BCE, four elaborately carved Toranas (ornamental gateways) and a balustrade (fancy rail) encircling the entire structure were added.</p>
<p>A number of Jakata's are shown including Syama Jataka, the Vessantara Jataka and the Mahakapi Jataka.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Depictions of the actual life of Gautama were made; only a few are given below:</li>
	<li>Miracle of the Buddha walking on the river Niranjana</li>

<br>
<h3>Philosophy</h3>
<h4>Overview</h4>
<ul>
	<li>We all take refuge in the Triple Jewel: the Buddha, our Teacher; the Dhamma, his teaching; and the Sangha, the Community of holy ones. In other words, we take refuge in the Teacher, the Teaching, and the Taught.</li>
	<li>Whether Theravada or Mahayana, we do not believe that this world is created and ruled by a god at his will.</li>
	<li>Following the example of the Buddha, our Teacher, who is the embodiment of Great Compassion (Mahakaruna) and Great Wisdom (Mahaprajña), we consider that the purpose of life is to develop compassion for all living beings without discrimination and to work for their good, happiness and peace; and to develop wisdom leading to the realization of Ultimate Truth.</li>
	<li>We accept the Four Noble Truths taught by the Buddha, namely, Dukkha, the fact that our existence in this world is in a predicament, is impermanent, imperfect, unsatisfactory, full of conflict; Samudaya, the fact that this state of affairs is due to our egoistic selfishness based on the false idea of self; Nirodha, the fact that there is definitely the possibility of deliverance, liberation, freedom from this predicament by the total eradication of the egoistic selfishness; and Magga, the fact that this liberation can be achieved through the Middle Path which is eight-fold, leading to the perfection of ethical conduct (Sila), mental discipline (Samadhi) and wisdom (Panna). We accept the universal law of cause and effect taught in the Paticcasamuppada, and accordingly, we accept that everything is relative, interdependent, and interrelated, and nothing is absolute, permanent, and everlasting in this universe.</li>
	<li>We understand, according to the teaching of the Buddha, that all conditioned things (Samkhara) are impermanent (Anicca) and imperfect and unsatisfactory (Dukkha), and all conditioned and unconditioned things (Dhamma) are without self (Anatta).</li>
	<li>We accept the Thirty-seven Qualities conducive to Enlightenment (Bodhipakkhiyadhamma) as different aspects of the Path taught by the Buddha leading to Enlightenment, namely:</li>

    <ul>
      <li>Four Forms of Presence of Mindfulness (Satipatthana);</li>
      <li>Four Right Efforts (Sammappadhana), mindset;</li>
      <li>Four Bases of Supernatural Powers (Iddhipada);</li>
      <li>Five Faculties (Indriya: Saddha, Viriya, Sati, Samadhi, Panna);</li>
      <li>Five Powers (Bala, same five qualities as above);</li>
      <li>Seven Factors of Enlightenment (Bojjhanga);</li>
      <li>Eight-fold Noble Path (Ariyamagga).</li>
    </ul>

    <li>There are three ways of attaining Bodhi or Enlightenment according to the ability and capacity of each individual: namely, as a disciple (Shravaka), as an Individual Buddha (Pratyekabuddha), and as a perfectly and fully enlightened Buddha (Samyaksambuddha ). We accept it as the highest, noblest, and most heroic to follow the career of a Bodhisattva and to become a Samyksambuddha in order to save others. But these three states are on the same path, not on different paths. In fact, the Sandhinirmocana-sutra, a well-known important Mahayana sutra, clearly and emphatically says that those who follow the line of Shravakayana (Vehicle of Disciples) or the line of Pratyekabuddhayana (Vehicle of Individual Buddhas) or the line of Tathagatas (Mahayana) attain the supreme Nirvana by the same Path, and that for all of them there is only one Path of Purification (Visuddhi-marga) and only one Purification (Visuddhi) and no second one, and that they are not different paths and different purifications, and that Shravakayana and Mahayana constitute One Vehicle One Yana (Ekayana) and not distinct and different vehicles or Yanas.</li>
    <li>We admit that in different countries, there are differences with regard to the ways of life of Buddhist monks, popular Buddhist beliefs and practices, rites and rituals, ceremonies, customs, and habits. These external forms and expressions should not be confused with the essential teachings of the Buddha.</li>
</ul>
<p>-One Vehicle for Peace by Ven. Walpola Sri Rahula, (December 1-7, 1981)</p>

<br>
<h4>The Eight-Fold Path (आर्याष्टाङ्गमार्ग)</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Right Resolve or Intention: the giving up of home and adopting the life of a religious mendicant in order to follow the path; this concept aims at peaceful renunciation, into an environment of non-sensuality, non-ill-will (to loving kindness), away from cruelty (to compassion). Such an environment aids contemplation of impermanence, suffering, and non-Self.</li>
	<li>Right Speech: no lying, no rude speech, no telling one person what another says about him to cause discord or harm their relationship.</li>
	<li>Right Conduct or Action: no killing or injuring, no taking what is not given, no sexual misconduct, no material desires.</li>
	<li>Right Livelihood: no trading in weapons, living beings, meat, liquor, and poisons.</li>
	<li>Right Effort: preventing the arising of unwholesome states and generating wholesome states, the bojjhaga (Seven Factors of Awakening). This includes Indriya-Samvara, "guarding the sense-doors", restraint of the sense faculties.</li>
	<li>Right Mindfulness (Sati; Satipatthana; Sampajañña): "retention", being mindful of the dhammas ("teachings", "elements") that are beneficial to the Buddhist path. In the vipassana movement, Sati is interpreted as "bare attention": never be Absent-minded, being conscious of what one is doing; this encourages the awareness of the impermanence of the body, feeling, and mind, as well as to experience the five aggregates (skandhas), the five hindrances, the four True Realities and seven factors of awakening.</li>
	<li>Right samadhi (Passaddhi; Ekaggata; Sampasadana): practicing four stages of dhyana ("meditation"), which includes samadhi proper in the second stage, and reinforces the development of the Bojjhaga, culminating into Upekkha (equanimity) and mindfulness. In the Theravada tradition and the vipassana movement, this is interpreted as Ekaggata, concentration or one-pointedness of the mind, and supplemented with vipassana meditation, which aims at insight.</li>
	<li>Right View: our actions have consequences, death is not the end, and our actions and beliefs have consequences after death. The Buddha followed and taught a successful path out of this world and the other world (heaven and underworld/hell). Later on, the right view came to explicitly include karma and rebirth and the importance of the Four Noble Truths when "insight" became central to Buddhist soteriology.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Schools</h3>
<p>Sthaviravada and Mahasanghika represent the first schism to occur in Buddhist history. It occurred 35 years after the Second Buddhist Council and was centered on five points made by the monk, Mahadeva, which essentially spoke about the fallibility of arahants (liberated beings). Specifically, Mahadeva argued that an arahant is still subject to passion, ignorance, and doubt and needs to receive instruction from others. They argue that only Buddhas have overcome these imperfections. The final point was that enlightenment could be obtained in a sudden shout. Sthaviravada rejected these points, while the Mahasaṅghikas agreed, and so arose a schism.</p>
<p>Sthaviravada is generally the more conservative of the two branches in that it sticks closer to what the early texts and the discourses of the Buddha say. For Sthaviravadins, Mahadeva's claims that arahants are still subject to passions, ignorance, and doubt are preposterous since an arahant has permanently extinguished the fires of greed, hatred, and delusion. It is why they are referred to as liberated in the first place. The fetter of doubt is overcome at the first stage of enlightenment, stream-entry. Sensual desire/passions are overcome at the third stage of enlightenment, non-returner. And ignorance is overcome at Arahant-ship, that is at final liberation.</p>
<p>Aside from talk of the fallibility of arahants, another dispute between the two sects is how the Buddha should be viewed. Mahasanghikas claim that the Buddha had both a physical body and a more abstract 'dharma-body.' The physical body of the Buddha was destroyed at his death, but his 'dharma-body' still pervades the world. In his dharma body, the Buddha is thus still teaching and providing guidance, and beings can still directly call upon the Buddha for help. Sthaviravada rejects the existence of this 'dharma body.' They say that the Buddha was just a person. When he passed away into final liberation, people thus can't directly access the Buddha. Though, of course, they do have access to the teachings he has left behind.</p>
<p>Another point of contention comes concerning more philosophical matters. About two to three centuries after the passing away of the Buddha, there arose a body of texts called the Abhidharma. Abhidharma is accepted as canonical by Sthaviravada. Mahasanghikas, on the other hand, reject its authority, but going into a further description, the Abhidharma is essentially a systematization of the Buddha's teachings. It unifies the various teachings presented in the suttas and draws out implicit meanings to create a single, cohesive picture of the nature of reality. The Abhidharma is simultaneously a philosophy, in that it answers the ontological question of what is real, psychology, in that it dissects and analyzes the workings of the mind, and an ethic, in that it defines and distinguishes the wholesome the and unwholesome, all integrated into a framework for the attainment of liberation. </p>
<p>The main subject of the Abhidharma treatises is 'dharmas,' which refer not to the Buddha's doctrine but instead refers to the irreducible constituents of the whole range of mental and material. While whole, composite objects like tables, trees, and persons are only conventionally real, the dharmas are ultimately real. They are the fundamental building blocks, and each has its own characteristics and functions. Dharmas exist only momentarily. They arise and cease while causally conditioning further dharmas. </p>
<p>Moreover, dharmas occur in conjunction with one and are tied together in a web of relationships. For example, consciousness arises, at the bare minimum, in conjunction with seven mental concomitant factors, namely sensory contact, feeling, perception, volition, one-pointedness, life faculty, and attention. All eight of these dharmas must arise together in order for the process of cognition to be possible.</p>
<p>Dharmas, it should be noted, are not substances in which characteristics inhere or substances that perform functions. Rather, dharmas are their respective characteristics and functions. This overcomes the duality of substance and qualities, which Buddhists argue is merely a convention used for the sake of communication as opposed to being something that has an actual ontological basis. Altogether, dharmas are a set of intersecting, causally-conditioned processes. It should be noted that Sthaviravada would see later schisms due to Abhidharma-related differences. Though the specifics of that are out of the scope of this discussion, in brief, Sthaviravada split into Vibhajyavada, Sarvastivada, and Pudgalavada. Vibhajyavada represents the baseline. Sarvastivada takes Vibhajyavada and adds on top of it the ontological existence of past and future dharmas. Pudgalavada takes Sarvastivada and adds on top of it the ontological existence of persons. Vibhajyavada rejects the ultimate existence of persons and argues that only present dharma has ontological existence. Theravada is the only school descended from Sthaviravada that still survives, and it falls within Vibhajyavada.</p>
<p>Mahasanghikas, as mentioned before, rejected the authority of the Abhidharma texts. While Sthaviravadins were more realist, Mahasanghikas trended toward nominalism and anti-realism as they claimed that the dharmas, just like whole objects, were not ultimately real themselves, and the distinction and descriptions of the various dharmas were merely convenient ways of dissecting phenomenal experience.</p>
<p>Finally, an important thing to discuss is the connection between Mahasangha and Mahayana. As mentioned before, Mahasanghikas, unlike the Sthaviravadins, believed that, while the Buddha's physical body had passed away, he was still alive in the transcendental form of his dharma-body was thus still working to liberate beings. This position should sound rather familiar, as it aligns with the Mahayana's more abstract conception of what a Buddha is. And indeed Mahasangha, in general, is almost representative of an early stage of Mahayana ideas. With parallels including the view of dharma-body, willingness to accept changes to monastic discipline, and rejection of the Abhidharmic preoccupations of their Sthaviravadin counterparts, which is to say that they rejected the fundamental existence of dharmas and trended more toward nominalisms like Mahayana and emptiness.</p>
<p>There has been much speculation over the tradition to which Nagarjuna, the famed philosopher whose ideas would forge the Mahayana, may have belonged since he appeared far too early in Indian history to be considered 'Mahayanika.'</p>
<p>The formation of the Mahayana seemed to have been less of a drastic schism as it was a gradual development, where during the early period, monks with more 'Mahayanika dispositions' resided at the same monasteries as their Abhidharmika and Mahasanghika counterparts. By virtue of his nominalist positions and geographical location in Andhra Pradesh, Nagarjuna has thus been designated as being part of Mahasanghika. Moreover, he shows the gradual emergence of Mahayana from the merging of a Mahasangha background with entirely new scriptures, unfound within early canons, like Prajnaparamita Sutra, which stepped up the nominalist position with the introduction of the concept of shunyata (emptiness) and gave increasingly more emphasis to the Bodhisattva ideal.</p>
<p>Going back to Mahadeva's five points, the fallibility of arahants, paired with the reinterpretation of the Buddha as being someone who was constantly at work liberating people, shows the Mahasangha's lowering of the position of the arahant. The arahant did not characterize the final stage of the Buddhist path and was still subject to the imperfections known to worldly beings. And indeed, while upholding the fallibility of arahants, the Mahasangha lauds the perfection of the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, viewing them as the true representatives of the Buddhist path. For the Mahasangha, then, we begin to see the germination of the Bodhisattva ideal, which would flower in the early Common Era with the influx of new scriptures and forging of the Mahayana. </p>

<h2>Jainism (Arhats)</h2>
<p>Early Astika had new religious perspectives that promoted asceticism, the abandonment of ritual, domestic and social action, and the attainment of spiritual illumination in an attempt to win, through one's own efforts, freedom from repeated rebirth (samsara).</p>
<p>Like Buddhism, there's no direct creator God, and everything is trying to reach Moksha being freed from Samsara. The goal for Jainist is to shed its karmic bonds entirely and then attain God-consciousness. They believe that every living thing has a soul (jiva), and every soul has divine potential leading to a strict practice of non-violence. </p>
<p>The first Jain figure for whom there is reasonable historical evidence is Parshvanatha (or Parshva), a renunciant teacher who may have lived in the 7th century BCE and founded a community based upon the abandonment of worldly concerns. Jain tradition regards him as the 23rd Tirthankara (literally, “Ford Maker”; i.e., one who leads the way across the stream of rebirths to salvation) of the current age (Kalpa). Unlike Buddhism, there's not a single founder, but multiple over different Kulpas. </p>
<p>Time, according to the Jains, is eternal and formless. It is understood as a wheel with 12 spokes (Ara), the equivalent of ages, six of which form an ascending arc and six a descending one. In the ascending arc (Utsarpini), humans progress in knowledge, age, stature, and happiness, while they deteriorate in the descending arc (Avasarpini). The two cycles joined together to make one rotation of the wheel of time, which is called a Kalpa. These Kalpas repeat themselves without beginning or end. </p>
<p>The Jain world is eternal and uncreated. Its constituent elements, the five basics of reality (Astikayas), are soul, matter, space, the principles of motion, and the arrest of motion. The fundamental tenet of Jain doctrine is that all phenomena are linked in a universal chain of cause and effect. Every event has a definite cause. By nature, each soul is pure, possessing infinite knowledge, bliss, and power; however, these faculties are restricted throughout time by the soul's contact with matter. This matter, which produces the chain of cause and effect, birth and death, is karma, an atomic substance and not a process, as it is in Hinduism and Buddhism. To be free from the shackles of karma, a person must stop the influx of new karmas and eliminate the acquired ones.</p>
<p>The Three Jewels constitute the basis of the Jain doctrinal and ethical stance (Shah):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Right belief</li>
  <li>Right knowledge</li>
  <li>Right conduct</li>
</ul>

<p>Kankali Tila architrave with Centaurs worshiping a Jain *stupa, Mathura, circa 100 BCE. The Katra architrave, possibly representing Brahmins and the cult of the Shiva Linga, Mathura, circa 100 BCE. They Are similar to the Buddhist domes, having a gate and a fence around on a raised platform.</p>

<h3>Udayagiri and Khandagiri Caves</h3>
<p>Also, the carved figures of Dwara Palas are found at the entrances. The carvings in this cave narrate the story of the elopement of Bassavadatta, Princess of Ujjayini, with King Udayana of Kausambi in the company of Vasantaka.</p>
<h3>Kankali Tila</h3>
<p>The mound, almost rectangular in shape, is 500 feet long by 350 feet broad. The sculptures and the inscriptions found at Kankali Tila suggest that in that period a clear Digambar-Shwetabar division had not risen. The Tirthankar images are all unclothed and monks are represented as not wearing a loincloth, but with cloth on one forearm. The names of divisions of the monastic orders match exactly with those given in the Kalpasutra. There's an inscription referencing the Vardhamana the 24th Tirthankara saying that the stupa was built in his honor.</p>

<h2>Ajivika</h2>
<p>Ajivika metaphysics included a theory of atoms later adapted in Vaishesika school. The Barabar caves belonging to the Ajivika sect are located in the state of Bihar. They lived in caves or were out in the woods, often naked. They were non-materialist atheists and believed your karma is predestined.  Whatever we know about this sect comes to us in the form of fragmentary references found in the Buddhist and Jain texts, and they are not reliable sources of information. </p>
<h3>Philosophy</h3>
<p>The views of six Shramana in the Pali Canon (based on the Buddhist text Samannaphala Sutta 1) (Bhikkhu):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Amoralism: denies any reward or punishment for either good or bad deeds.</li>
  <li>Niyativada (Fatalism): we are powerless; suffering is pre-destined.</li>
  <li>Materialism: live happily; with death, all is annihilated.</li>
  <li>Sassatavada (Eternalism): Matter, pleasure, pain, and the soul are eternal and do not interact.</li>
  <li>Restraint: be endowed with, cleansed by, and suffused with the avoidance of all evil.</li>
  <li>Agnosticism: "I don't think so. I don't think in that way or otherwise. I don't think not or not not." Suspension of judgment.</li>
</ul>

<p>Ajivikas believed that in every being, there is a soul (Atman). However, unlike Jains and various orthodox schools of Hinduism that held that soul is formless, Ajivikas asserted that the soul has a material form, one that helps meditation. They also believed that the soul passes through many births and ultimately progresses unto its pre-destined nirvana (salvation). Basham states that some texts suggest evidence of Vaishnavism-type devotional practices among some Ajivikas. </p>
<h3>Barabar Caves</h3>
<p>This was a large cave complex donated to the Ajivikas by Ashoka during his reign. Often these had stones that were polished to a mirror-like finish. They would most likely sit and meditate in the fetal positions in these rooms.</p>

<h2>Vedic Religion of The Brahmins</h2>

<p>The tradition originated from admixture from BMAC, Indo-Aryan, and later Indus Valley civilization religion. These over time congealed into a final Vedic form following bhramins as the keepers of the religion. A 383 foreign lone words in Vedic Sanskrit suggest that innermixing of culture happened with at least some nearby culture.</p>
<p>"Many of the qualities of Indo-Iranian god of might/victory, Verethraghna, were transferred to the adopted god Indra, who became the central deity of the developing Old Indic culture. Indra was the subject of 250 hymns, a quarter of the Rig Veda. He was associated more than any other deity with Soma, a stimulant drug (perhaps derived from Ephedra) probably borrowed from the BMAC religion. His rise to prominence was a peculiar trait of the Old Indic speakers."</p>
<p>The oldest inscriptions in Old Indic, the language of the Rig Veda, are found not in northwestern India and Pakistan, but in northern Syria, the location of the Mitanni kingdom. The Mitanni kings took Old Indic throne names, and Old Indic technical terms were used for horse-riding and chariot-driving. The Old Indic term r'ta, meaning "cosmic order and truth", the central concept of the Rig Veda, was also employed in the Mitanni kingdom. Old Indic gods, including Indra, were also known in the Mitanni kingdom.</p>
<p>Indo-Aryans originally came into the valley, following the collapse of the Indus Valley Civalization, bringing with Vedic tration. The Vedic religion, and subsequent Brahmanism center on the myths and ritual ideologies of the Vedas, as distinguished from Agamic, Tantric and sectarian forms of Indian religion, which take recourse to the authority of non-Vedic textual sources. Vedic religion and tradition is described in the Vedas, or early Upanishads and has been preserved into modern times by different schools. It existed in the western Ganges plain in the early Vedic period from c. 1500-1100 BCE, and developed into Brahmanism in the late Vedic period (1100-500 BCE). The eastern Ganges-plain was dominated by another Indo-Aryan complex, which rejected the later Brahmanical ideology, and gave rise to Jainism and Buddhism, and the Mauryan Empire.</p>
<p>Brahman was understood as an individual entity but so immensely powerful that the human mind could not comprehend it. This being existed in reality (it could be apprehended), outside of reality (in the realm of pre-existence), and was reality all at once. Brahman had always existed and would always exist but was far too immense for a human being to connect with. The gods of the Vedic pantheon were avatars of this being, but in order to have a personal connection, there had to be some aspect of the human constitution that would allow for it.</p>
<p>Neither the priests who recited the Vedas nor those who heard them referred to this belief system as Brahmanism. The term 'Brahmanism' was only coined by European scholars in the 16th century CE and came to be used interchangeably with Hinduism. The universe was understood as having been ordered for a purpose by a divine intelligence, and each individual had a part to play in that purpose. Hinduism developed the particulars of how a person was to play their part.</p>
<p>Wanting to be free from the system setup by the caste system, a system where a rigid set of rules dictate where you are in society. Different nastika religions formed around 500BCE, Buddisms being a well known example, but also Jainism and Ajivika. The system, before Brittish influence making it even more ridgid was in 4 to 5 tears named the Varna.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Brahmins: vedic scholars, priests and teachers.</li>
	<li>Kshatriyas: rulers, warriors and administrators.</li>
	<li>Vaishyas: agriculturalists and merchants.</li>
	<li>Shudras: laborers and service providers.</li>
</ul>

<p>These including a set of rules dicated where and who you were in society. Who you interacted with and how you went about your daily life, who you married, etc. These were aspects controlled by this late system of thought, leading to reforms.</p>

<h3>Vedic Gods</h3>

<h4>Indra (इन्द्र)</h4>
<p>He is the king of Svarga (Heaven) and the Devas (gods). He is associated with lightning, thunder, storms, rains, river flows, and war. Indra's mythology and powers are similar to other Indo-European deities such as Jupiter, Perun, Perkūnas, Zalmoxis, Taranis, Zeus, and Thor, suggesting a common origin in Proto-Indo-European mythology.</p>

<h4>Agni (अग्नि)</h4>
<p>He is a Sanskrit word meaning fire and connotes the fire god of Hinduism. He is also the guardian deity of the southeast direction and is typically found in the southeast corners of Hindu temples. Agni is considered the mouth of the gods and goddesses and the medium that conveys offerings to them in a Homa (votive ritual). He is conceptualized in ancient Hindu texts to exist at three levels, on earth as fire, in the atmosphere as lightning, and in the sky as the sun. This triple presence connects him as the messenger between gods and human beings in the Vedic thought.</p>

<h4>Chandra (चंंन्द्र)</h4>
<p>Also known as Soma, is the Hindu god of the Moon, and is associated with the night, plants, and vegetation. The origin of Soma is traced back to the Hindu Vedic texts, where is he is the personification of a drink made from a plant with the same name.</p>

<h4>Rudra (रुद्र)</h4>
<p>He is a Rigvedic deity associated with wind or storm, Vayu, and the hunt. One translation of the name is ‘the roarer'. In the Rigveda, Rudra is praised as the ‘mightiest of the mighty'. Rudra means “who eradicates problems from their roots”. Depending upon the periodic situation, Rudra can mean ‘the most severe roarer/howler' (could be a hurricane or tempest) or 'the most frightening one'.</p>

<h4>Ashvins (अश्विन्)</h4>
<p>They are also known as Ashwini Kumara and Asvinau, are Hindu twin gods associated with medicine, health, dawn, and sciences. In the Rigveda, they are described as youthful divine twin horsemen, traveling in a chariot drawn by horses that are never weary, and portrayed as guardian deities that safeguard and rescue people by aiding them in various situations.</p>

<h4>Varuna (वरुन)</h4>
<p>He is a Vedic deity associated initially with the sky, later also with the seas as well as Ṛta (justice) and Satya (truth). He is found in the oldest layer of Vedic literature of Hinduism, such as hymn 7.86 of the Rigveda.</p>

<h4>Maruts (मरुत)</h4>
<p>According to the Rig Veda, they wore golden helmets and breastplates and used their axes to split the clouds so that rain could fall. They were capable of shaking mountains and destroying forests. Though they were the offspring of Rudra, they were adopted by Indra, who was entitled as Marutvant ("Accompanied by the Maruts").</p>

<h4>Mitra (मित्र)</h4>
<p>He is a divinity of Indic culture, whose function changed with time. In the Mitanni inscription, Mitra is invoked as one of the protectors of treaties. In the Rigveda, Mitra appears primarily in the dvandva compound Mitra-Varuna, which has essentially the same attributes as Varuna alone, e.g. as the principal guardian of ṛtá "Truth, Order". In the late Vedic texts and the Brahmanas, Mitra is increasingly associated with the light of dawn and the morning sun. In the post-Vedic texts - in which Mitra practically disappears - Mitra evolved into the patron divinity of friendship, and because he is "friend", abhors all violence, even when sacred.</p>

<h4>Ushas (उषस्)</h4>
<p>She is a Vedic goddess of dawn in Hinduism. She repeatedly appears in the Rigvedic hymns, states David Kinsley, where she is “consistently identified with the dawn, revealing herself with the daily coming of light to the world, driving away oppressive darkness, chasing away evil demons, rousing all life, setting all things in motion, sending everyone off to do their duties”. She is the life of all living creatures, the impeller of action and breath, the foe of chaos and confusion, the auspicious arouser of cosmic and moral order called the Ṛta in Hinduism.</p>

<h4>Vayu (वायु)</h4>
<p>He is a primary Hindu deity, the lord of the winds as well as the deity of breath. In the Rigveda, Vayu is associated with the winds, with the Maruts being described as being born from Vayu's belly. Vayu is also the first god to receive soma in the ritual, and then he and Indra share their first drink. This god's iconography dipicts him holding a bag of wind, this can be traced back to Greek Influence from the Greek wind god Boreas. </p>

<h4>Savitr (सविता)</h4>
<p>He is sometimes identified with—and at other times distinguished from—Surya, "the Sun-god". When considered distinct from the Sun proper, he is conceived of as the divine influence or vivifying power of the Sun. The Sun before sunrise is called Savitr, and after sunrise, until sunset, it is called Surya. </p>

<h4>Ribhus (ऋभु)</h4>
He is an ancient Indian word whose meaning evolved over time. In early layers of the Vedic literature, it referred to a sun deity. It evolved to being a wind deity, thereafter referred to three male artisans whose abilities and austerities make them into divinities in later Vedic texts.

<h4>Pushan (पूषन्)</h4>
<p>He's considered the lord of paths and a guardian of cattles. He protects the people from wild animals and does not allow them to stray onto dangerous paths. He keeps their journey stable and obstacle-free. He protected travelers from bandits and wild beasts and protected men from being exploited by other men. He is also a friend of Indra and Surya. He was a psychopomp (soul guide), conducting souls to the other world. He was a supportive guide, a "good" god, leading his adherents towards rich pastures and wealth.</p>

<h4>Surya (सूर्य)</h4>
<p>The sun and the solar deity in Hinduism, particularly in the Saura tradition found in Indian states such as Rajasthan, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, and Odisha. The iconography of Surya is often depicted riding a chariot harnessed by horses, often seven in number which represents the seven colors of visible light, and seven days in a week.</p>

<h4>Vishnu (विष्णु)</h4>
<p>In these hymns, the Vedic mythology asserts that Vishnu resides in that highest home where departed Atman (Self) resides, an assertion that may have been the reason for his increasing emphasis and popularity in Hindu soteriology. He is also described in Vedic literature as the one who supports heaven and earth. In the Vedic hymns, Vishnu is invoked alongside other deities, especially Indra, whom he helps in killing the symbol of evil named Vritra.</p>

<h4>Brahmanaspati (बृहस्पति)</h4>
<p>He's also known as Guru, is a Hindu god. In the ancient Vedic scriptures of Hinduism, Brihaspati is a deity associated with fire, and the word also refers to a rishi (sage) who counsels the devas (gods). In some later texts, the word refers to the largest planet of the solar system, Jupiter, and the deity is associated with the planet as a Navagraha.</p>

<h4>Yama (यम)</h4>
<p>He is a deity of death, dharma, the south direction, and the underworld who predominantly features in Hindu and Buddhist mythology, belonging to an early stratum of Rigvedic Hindu deities.  In Sanskrit, his name can be interpreted to mean "twin". In Hinduism, Yama is the son of sun-god Surya and Sanjana. Yama is the brother of Sraddhadeva Manu and of his older sister Yami. According to the Vedas, Yama is said to have been the first mortal who died. By virtue of precedence, he became the ruler of the departed, and is called "Lord of the Pitrs".</p>

<h4>Kubera (कुबेर)</h4>
<p>He is the god of wealth and the god-king of the semi-divine Yakshas in Hindu culture. He is regarded as the regent of the North, and a protector of the world. His many epithets extol him as the overlord of numerous semi-divine species and the owner of the treasures of the world.</p>

<h4>Brahma (ब्रह्म)</h4>
<p>She is the Hindu goddess of knowledge, music, art, speech, wisdom, and learning. Saraswati is a Sanskrit fusion word of Saras (सरस्) meaning "pooling water", but also sometimes translated as "speech"; and Vati (वती) meaning "she who possesses". Originally associated with the river or rivers known as Saraswati.</p>

<h4>Laksmi (लक्ष्मी)</h4>
<p>Lakshmi is also known as Shri, is one of the principal goddesses in Hinduism. She is the goddess of wealth, fortune, power, beauty, and prosperity, and associated with Maya ("Illusion"). A God widespread "she who leads to one's goal.", she was on coins and in temples since 125BC.</p>

<h4>Vritra (वृत्र)</h4>
<p>He is a Vedic serpent, dragon, or demon in Hinduism, the personification of drought and adversary of Indra. Vritra is identified as an asura. Vritra was also known in the Vedas as Ahi (Sanskrit: अहि ahi, lit. "snake"). He appears as a dragon blocking the course of the rivers and is heroically slain by Indra.</p>
<br>

<p>Much of vedic religion focuses on the god Indra being the main god of their pantheon. Indra fought the red dragon Vritra, symbolized as a person, to release the waters and rivers back onto the earth. Different gods are invoked and remembers and their stories usually written down in hymn, or poetic form. Rituals and other things are also laid out in parts of the vedas and the earlier caste, or Varna system.</p>
<p>Names of Vedic Gods are found in some texts about the Mitanni Empire in the western Iranian area. Brahmans are part of the Vedic faith which is already an extension. Many of the Vedic Gods were present in the stories of Buddhism, Jainism, and Hinduism. Mahesvara (Shiva), Sakra (Indra), Brahma, Sarasvati, Laksmi are depicted in Buddhist art. Indra, Surya, Chandra, Yama, Varuna, and Kubera are mentioned in the Naneghat inscription. Thirty-three deities are emphasized, and different ethical concepts include: Satya, Rta, etc., are mentioned in The Vedas. The rites of grave burials and cremation have been seen since the Rigvedic period. The idea of reincarnation, or Samsara, is not mentioned in the early layers of the historical Vedic religion texts such as the Rigveda. According to Ranade, the last layers of the Rigveda say ideas that suggest an approach towards the concept of rebirth. The early layers of the Vedas do not mention the doctrine of Karma and rebirth but mention the belief in an afterlife.</p>

<h3>Rituals</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fire rituals involving oblations (Havir)</li>
	<li>The Pashubandhu, the (semi-)annual animal sacrifice</li>
	<li>The Soma rituals, which involved the extraction, utility, and consumption of Soma</li>
	<li>The royal consecration (Rajasuya) sacrifice</li>
	<li>The Ashvamedha (horse sacrifice) or a Yajna dedicated to the glory, wellbeing, and prosperity of the kingdom or empire,</li>
	<li>The Purushamedha, a Shrauta ritual of human sacrifice,</li>
	<li>The traditions and charms referred to in the Atharvaveda are concerned with medicine and healing practices</li>
	<li>The Gomedha or cow sacrifice</li>
</ul>
<p>(Wujastyk)</p>

<p>Cremation (Agnidagdha) and uncremated (Anagnidagdha) forms of burial were performed sense the Rig-Vedic period. Though many names for devas occur in Rigveda, only Thirty-Three devas are counted, eleven each of earth, space, and heaven. The Vedic pantheon knows two classes, Devas and Asuras. </p>

<h1>History Preface</h1>
<h3>Model Of Empires Pre-Intro</h3>
<p>The military historian Sir John Bagot Glubb studied eleven empires, starting with the Assyrians in 859 B.C. and ending with the British in 1950 A.D. Sir John determined that each followed a remarkably similar pattern from birth to demise. Spanning a period of about ten generations, each went through 7 Stages of Empire:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The Age of Pioneers (Outburst)</li>
	<li>The Age of Conquests</li>
	<li>The Age of Commerce</li>
	<li>The Age of Affluence</li>
	<li>The Age of Intellect</li>
	<li>The Age of Decadence</li>
	<li>The Age of Decline & Collapse</li>
</ul>

<p>Glubb noted that the penultimate age was marked by defensiveness, pessimism, materialism, frivolity, an influx of foreigners, the Welfare State, and a weakening of religion in all these examples. He attributed this decadence to an excessively long period of wealth and power, selfishness, love of money, and the loss of a sense of duty.</p>

<h1>History</h1>
<p>The Indo-Greek Kingdom stretched from Modern-day Pakistan into North India. These Climates were mostly Humid to Tropical with some Mountainous regions in the North Satraps. West of the Ganges did most grain farming due to the lack of humidity and lower rainfall.</p>

<p>Many varieties of rice and the produce varied from Karumbhak to Red rice. Cornucopias were associated with grain production in Bactria, being on several ancient coins. The "Plough" was associated with Balarama/Samkarshana, coins often depicting them holding those farming tools. Rivers in India were significant for irrigation. They made underground canals called Uponomoi (υπονοµοι) to help cultivate more produce. Although irrigation techniques declined over time as the YueShi started to invade.</p>
<p>Gold was mainly from South India, along with various precious stones. Mining had been done since ancient times west of the Ganges, being rich in copper and iron ores, making it a valuable location to hold. They even had a lapis-lazuli trade route from Badakhshan to Bagram and Kabul.</p>
<p>The Indo-Greek kings in Southern Asia issued the first known cupro-nickel coins, with Euthydemus II, dating from 180 to 170 BC, and his younger brothers Pantaleon and Agathocles around 170 BC. As only China was able to produce cupro-nickel at that time, and as the alloy ratios are exclusively similar, it has been suggested that the metal was the result of exchanges between China and Bactria.</p>

<p>They also traded with several neighboring groups, as seen by their religious culture and artwork change, from Greek statues and Gods to more Indianized Styles of statues and Buddhism as their widespread religion. Frequently coins and statues depicted men wearing Graeco-Roman-style coats, scarfs, trousers, turbans, with fibulas. Musical instruments are also depicted in carvings, such as the Aulos double flute. Also visible are carnyx-like horns.</p>
<p>Many of the statues and carvings have been done by Greek-Buddist monks who helped build monasteries. Many of the Indo-Greeks and their rulers were devout Buddhists, as often described in religious texts. This wasn't always the case as one of the ambassadors of Antialcidas did have connections and gave funding to the Bhagavata cult.</p>
<p>The Government was a Monarchy consisting of Kingships with usually more minor local rules for essential cities. It ruled over the people taking taxes and helping do more extensive projects and military ventures. Most Kings lived in open palaces similar to Greek Palaces in and around Greece. Cities under their control were made into the typical Greek Checker Board layout from their original, more unorganized style.</p>
<p>Most kings had some form of military or protection from outside threats. Some of the following text gives us good insight into Indo-Greek Militaries.</p>

<figure>
  <blockquote cite="">
      <p>(Nagasena) 'Has it ever happened to you, O king, that rival kings rose up against you as enemies and opponents?'<br>
        (Menander) 'Yes, certainly.'<br>
        'Then you set to work, I suppose, to have moats dug, and ramparts thrown up, and watchtowers erected, and strongholds built, and stores of food collected?'<br>
        'Not at all. All that had been prepared beforehand.'<br>
        'Or you had yourself trained in the management of war elephants, and horsemanship, and the use of the war chariot, and in archery and fencing?'<br>
        'Not at all. I had learned all that before.'<br>
        'But why?'<br>
        'With the object of warding off future danger.

<p>These militaries campaign all around India, trying to gain land and new territory. Their warriors' equipped with boots, chiton, swords, and Greek Phrygian helmets. They expanded their territory and allowed for new trade and new mining opportunities. One of the following quotes is from when they took over Pataliputra, modern Ayodhya.</p>

<figure>
  <blockquote cite="">
      <p>After having conquered Saketa, the country of the Panchala and the Mathuras, The Yavanas, wicked and valiant, will reach Kusumadhvaja ("The town of the flower-standard,” Pataliputra). With the thick mud-fortifications at Pataliputra being reached, all the provinces will be in disorder, without a doubt. Ultimately, a great battle will follow, with tree-like engines (siege engines).</p>
  </blockquote>

<p>Sometime during the 1st century BC, the Greeks (Yavanas) were pushed back into Mathura.</p>

<p>These events started the decline of Indo-Greek culture and the spread of Indo-Greeks in general. The Sakas were a group of nomadic tribes that came down from the north into India. They eventually displaced the Indo-Greeks, forcing them back into central India.</p>

<figure>
  <blockquote cite="">
      <p>Sakas were Iranian-speaking horse nomads who deployed chariots in battle, sacrificed horses, and buried their dead in barrows or mound tombs called kurgans.</p>

<p>The Sakas, a group of loosely connected tribes from Western India, spoke the Saka language, known as Khotanese, as first attested in the Tarim Basin. They slowly took over the north Punjab area from the Indo-Greeks; much of Indo-Parthian culture was a fusion of the migrating Scythian culture with the local Hellenized Culture and added many different and new things into the new fused culture.</p>
<p>The Saka introduced many Iranian plants, herbs, and vegetables to India. The Milindapanho, while describing a storehouse of the wealthy (IV.1.27), mentioned the existence of </p>
<p>all kinds of wheat, rice, paddy, barley, dry grain, oilseeds, beans, peas, and edible seeds. Although not much else changed when they began to invade.</p>
<p>Many small tribes invaded and took over different parts of the Northern Satraps, Bactria, and Lower Satraps. Most likely, the various Monarchies represented other tribes. They all soaked up much of the previous Indo-Greek culture into their own, but a lot of the Original Indo-Greek technology was lost.</p>
<p>Indo-Scythian soldiers in military attire are sometimes represented in Buddhist friezes in the art of Gandhara (particularly in Buner reliefs). They are depicted in fabulous tunics with trousers and have heavy straight swords as weapons.  They wear pointed hoods or the Scythian cap (see Pointed hat), distinguishing them from the Indo-Parthians who only wore a simple fillet over their bushy hair.</p>
<p>Another relief is known where the same soldiers play musical instruments and dance, activities widely represented elsewhere in Gandharan art: Indo-Scythians are typically shown as reveling devotees. The Indo-Scythians seem to have been followers of Buddhism, and many of their practices continued those of the Indo-Greeks.</p>

<p>Eventually, the Scythian Kingdoms would fall under a more ordered power, being in considerable disarray. The kingdom fell around 19BC, leaving a sizable legacy of art, references in literature, and depiction in coins.</p>
<p>The Indo-Parthians, at their best, ruled an area covering parts of eastern Iran, various pieces of Afghanistan, and the northwest regions of the Indian subcontinent, including most of modern Pakistan, parts of the Jammu Division, and the eastern Punjab region in India.</p>
<p>The first King of Indo-Parthia was Gondophares I, who took over much of what used to be the Indo-Scythian Kingdom. He initially seems to have been a ruler of Seistan in today's eastern Iran.  He's probably a vassal or relative of the Apracarajas.  Around 20-10 BC, he conquered the former Indo-Scythian kingdom, perhaps after the death of the paramount ruler Azes. Gondophares became the ruler of areas comprising  Arachosia, Seistan, Sindh, Punjab, and the Kabul valley, but it does not seem to hold territory beyond eastern Punjab.</p>
<p>The Greek philosopher Apollonius of Tyana was related by Philostratus in Life of Apollonius Tyana to have visited India, specifically the city of Taxila, around 46 AD. He describes constructions of the Greek type, probably referring to Sirkap, and explains that the Indo-Parthian king of Taxila, named Phraotes, received a Greek education at the court of his father and spoke Greek fluently:</p>

<figure>
  <blockquote cite="">
      <p>'Tell me, O King, how you acquired such a command of the Greek tongue, <br>
        and whence you derived all your philosophical attainments in this place?'...<br>
        'My father, after a Greek education, brought me to the sages at an age somewhat too early perhaps, for I was only twelve at the time, but they brought me up like their own son; for any that they admit knowing the Greek tongue, they are especially fond of because they consider that in virtue of the similarity of his disposition, he already belongs to themselves.'
        </p>
  </blockquote>
  <figcaption>—Apollonius of Tyana</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Their religion was Zoroastrianism, a prophet-based religion dealing with the constant battle of Good and Evil. It's a monotheistic religion, with their primary God being Ahura Mazda. Ahura gave Zoroaster a revelation that he was the son of God and to tell everyone of his existence. Much of this religion takes the previous Vedic substratum and adds in Messianic and Monotheistic elements.</p>
<p>Zoroastrianism rejects extreme forms of asceticism and monasticism but historically has allowed for moderate expressions of these concepts. The religion states that active and ethical participation in life through good deeds formed from good thoughts and good words is necessary to ensure happiness and to keep chaos at bay. This active participation is a central element in Zoroaster's concept of free will.</p>
<p>They ruled with a Monarchy with Sub-Monarchies over certain city-states. Trade was also relatively similar, relying on China and the Indian sub-Continent trade.</p>
<p>They are depicted with short crossover jackets & oversized baggy trousers, possibly supplemented by Chap-like over-trousers. Their jackets are adorned with decorative rings or medals, hair is usually bushy and contained with a headband. Sase was followed by Orthagnes depicted with a simple tiara and by Ubouzanes, in Greek legend he specifies as Orthaganes' son.</p>
<p>Little is known about these people; their kingdoms started to fall once Gondophares died in 49AD. Whatever was left to dissolve until entirely disbanded by 220AD slowly.</p>
<p>Gradually wresting control of the area from the Scythian tribes, the Kushans expanded south into the region traditionally known as Gandhara. An area lying primarily in Pakistan's Pothwar and Northwest Frontier Provinces region but going in an arc to include Kabul valley and part of Kandahar in Afghanistan, and established twin capitals.</p>
<p>The Kushan Empire was fully established around 1AD, being composed of Iranic Yuezhi tribes. However, they may have been influenced by The Tocherian people, having sent an army to the Tarim Basin to support the city-state of Kucha, resisting the Chinese.</p>

<figure>
  <blockquote cite="">
      <p>The knights in chain-mail armor have analogies in the Khalchayan reliefs depicting a battle of the Yuezhi against a Saka tribe (probably the Sakaraules). Apart from the chain-mail armor worn by the heavy cavalry of the enemies of the Yuezhi, the other characteristic sign of these warriors is long side-whiskers (...) We think it is possible to identify all these grotesque personages with long side-whiskers as enemies of the Yuezhi and relate them to the Sakaraules (...) Indeed these expressive ﬁgures with side-whiskers differ greatly from the tranquil and majestic faces and poses of the Yuezhi depictions.

<p>They were displacing and Occupying the western part of what used to be the Indo-Parthian Kingdom. Heraios, the first Kushan King coin's depicted him with artificial skull deformation, a characteristic of several Kushan portraits and sculptures of the 1st century CE. Heraios may have been the father of the first Kushan emperor Kujula Kadphises. Kujula Kadphises invaded sometime between AD 45 and 60 and laid the basis for the Kushan Empire.</p>

<p>The rule of the Kushans linked the seagoing trade of the Indian Ocean with the commerce of the Silk Road through the long-civilized Indus Valley. At the height of the dynasty, the Kushans loosely oversaw a territory that extended to the Aral Sea through present-day Uzbekistan, Afghanistan, and Pakistan into northern India. The Kushans had been predominantly Zoroastrian and later Buddhist. They also hand an array of Gods that they put on their coins; one of them seems to have been a precursor to Shiva. From the time of Wima Takto, many Kushans started adopting aspects of Indian culture like the other nomadic groups who had invaded India, principally the Royal clans of Gujjars. </p>
<p>Many depictions of the Kushans have beards, medium-length hair, and a headband. Their main garments were an outer coat, a long undershirt with a belt on, long flowing pants, and shoes. Many depictions of the people showed head binding and something they would hold in their left or right hand.</p>
<p>To the south of the Satraps lies middle India, where the Satavahana Kingdom existed. A great trade power and importance to the northern kingdoms of India.</p>
<p>The Satavahanas lived near the Deccan Plateau, and the climate was relatively tropical. The Satavahanas were pretty acquainted with the use of iron and agriculture. They mined the rich mineral resources of the Deccan Plateau. Such as iron ores from Karimnagar and Warangal and gold from Kolar fields. Many coins issued were made of lead, which is found on the Deccan Plateau, and coins of copper and bronze. As a result of forest clearance and construction of irrigation reservoirs fed by drainage systems leading water into soakage pits. Agriculture flourished, rice farming was done between the Krishna and Godavari rivers, and large cotton industry. The technologies from the north and significant trade allowed for an advanced economy.</p>
<p>The Satavahanas controlled the Indian sea coast, and as a result, they dominated the growing Indian trade with the Roman Empire. They traded many goods, including Gandhi perfumes, grains, cloth, pottery, and even ivory. They often traded with many different people throughout the world by use of ships. Craftsmen guilds existed, allowing for creating sculptures, pottery, and the like. Evidence for this was an ivory statuette of Lakshmi found in the ruins of Pompeii.</p>
<p>The official language of the Satavahanas was a Middle Indo-Aryan language (Maharashtra ?)  written in Brahmi script. The Satavahanas were Hindus and claimed Brahmanical status, although they also made generous donations to Buddhist monasteries. The laypeople in the Satavahana period generally did not exclusively support a particular religious group. Political inscriptions also threw some light on the rare use of Sanskrit Literature.</p>
<p>Simuka is the first king in a list of royals in a Satavahana inscription at Naneghat. The various Puranas state that the dynasty's first king ruled for 23 years and mentioned his different names as Sishuka, Sindhuka, Chhismaka, Shipraka, etc. These are believed to be corrupted spellings of Simuka, resulting from copying and re-copying of manuscripts.</p>
<p>Three different types of settlements existed: Nagara (city), Nigama (market town), and Gama (village). Their government was less top-heavy than that of the Mauryans and retained some of the administrative units of Ashokan times.</p>
<p>Rajan, the hereditary rulers<br>Rajas, petty princes who struck coins in their own names<br>Maharathis, hereditary lords who could grant villages in their own names and maintained matrimonial relations with the ruling family<br>Mahabhojas<br>Mahasenapati (civil administrator under Pulumavi II; governor of a janapada under Pulumavi IV)<br>Mahatalavara ("great watchman")</p>
<p>The royal princes (kumaras) were appointed as rulers of the provinces. The kingdom was divided into several inscriptions called Aharas, and a local governor was appointed to rule them. This was done partly for military gain, allowing for quicker decisions of local people. There was also a sizable monetary aspect, allowing for more direct taxation of villages. Although, tax-free villages for Brahmanas and Buddhists existed. The administration in the rural areas was placed in the hands of the Mahatalavara. Mahatalavara's were the head of a military regiment consisting of nine chariots, nine elephants, twenty-five horses, and forty-five foot soldiers. They dressed relatively minimally in a Tunic, Boots, Headband, and Antalya and carried a Sword.</p>
<p>Finally, we come to the Western Satraps to bring it back northwest. A government initially ruled by the now displaced Scythians. They were a monarchy ruled by Kshaharatas, and their earliest recording was on the Taxila copper plate inscription from the 6AD. The next earliest Kshaharata for which there is evidence is Abhiraka, whose rare coins are known. He was succeeded by Bhumika, father of Nahapana, who only used Satrap's title on his coins and not that of Raja or Rano (king). </p>
<p>After a long reign, Nahapana was ultimately defeated by the powerful Satavahana king Gautamiputra Satakarni. Gautamiputra drove the Sakas from Malwa and Western Maharashtra, forcing Nahapana west to Gujarat. His victory is known because Gautamiputra re-struck many of Nahapana's coins. It seems that the Indian colonization of the islands of Java and Sumatra took place during the time of the Western Satraps. People may have fled the sub-continent due to the conflicts there.</p>
<p>The Western Satraps are known for the construction and dedication of numerous Buddhist caves in Central India, particularly in Maharashtra and Gujarat. They bear inscriptions showing many different ethnic groups that worked on carving caves. Some being Greek, Saka, or later Kushans. Written records show they were predominantly Buddist but also supported Hindu and Brahmanism. </p>
<p>Being right on the coast of the western Indian Sea, they had direct access to trade with Arabia and the Horn of Africa. Some of their goods even made it to Italy and Pompeii. This was recorded in a koine greek text, “Periplus of the Erythraean Sea”, most likely the author, a self-acclaimed Athenian, was actually from Berenice. It gives excellent insight into what was available to the Western Satraps in terms of food and everyday items.</p>

That part of it lying inland and adjoining Scythia is called Abiria, but the coast is called Syrastrene. It is a fertile country, yielding wheat and rice and sesame oil and clarified butter, cotton, and the Indian cloths made therefrom, of the coarser sorts. Very many cattle are pastured there, and the men are of great stature and black in color. The metropolis of this country is Minnagara, from which much cotton cloth is brought down to Barygaza.

<h1>Towns and Everyday Life</h1>
<p>Trade organizations formed called Shreni which were guilds for different types of goods. These guilds helped train artisans, help with taxes, and keep products regular and flowing. Markets and stores existed, and many foreigners came to them to buy and sell. Some marketplaces depicted are a banana shop and a honey shop, among others. Transportation in towns were commonly Bull carts, Chariots, and for kids Tricycles. Other forms of transportation depicted or found were Horses, Elephants, Camels, Bulls, and Boats.</p>
<p>Some common jobs such as Agriculture, Potters, Metal Workers, Live Stock. Agriculture was the government's main mode of income. Reservoirs and wells were used to help with agriculture, and records of makings dams exist. There was no mention of an irrigation tax during this period and only appears in the middle ages.</p>
<p>"It was measured out in fine and regular quarters. It was fortified with ramparts and excavated moats. It had stout gateways and towers. Besides dwellings, cities included market places, crossroads, street corners, and public squares, with clear and even main roads with regular lines of open shops, well provided with parks, gardens, lakes, lotus ponds, wells, and adorned with many kinds of temples of the Gods." - Milinda Panho's description of a city. (Bahn and Renfrew p. 407 - 429)</p>
<p>Walled and moated cities with large gates and multi-storied buildings which consistently used chaitya arches, no doubt in wood, for roofs and upper structures above more solid stories are important features of the architecture during this period. The reliefs of Sanchi, dated to the 1st centuries BCE-CE, show cities such as Kushinagar or Rajagriha as splendid walled cities, as in the Royal cortege leaving Rajagriha or War over the Buddha's relics. These views of ancient Indian cities have been relied on for the understanding of ancient Indian urban architecture.</p>
<p>"We nowhere hear of isolated houses. The houses were all together, in groups, separated only by narrow lanes'' - Manasara.</p>
<p>Towns seemed to have been based on military camps and were built near a river or mountain situated East to West or North to South. There should be one to twelve large streets in a town and should have facilities for trade and commerce with foreigners. It should be furnished with walls, moats, ditches, gates, drains, parks, common shops, temples, guest houses, colleges, etc. Community wells were made from terracotta and went deep into the earth (one was 45ft down, and another 250ft). </p>
<p>Five different types of Houses existed in Ancient India (Vishnu p. 165):</p>
<ol>
	<li>Wattle and Daub are supported by wooden posts with thatched roofs.</li>
	<li>Mud Brick structures with thatched roofing.</li>
	<li>Mud Brick-cum-burnt brick structures.</li>
	<li>Mud Brick/burnt brick-cum-mud walls with wooden posts.</li>
	<li>Burnt brick structures with tiled roofs.</li>
</ol>
<p>Domestic houses were made of bricks and usually flat-roofed; the wooden doors were provided with hangings and a lock at the bottom. The houses were single or double storied. The windows were provided with lattice shutters for airflow and privacy and ledge to stop rainwater from entering the house. Their Living quarters had different tables and chairs, and sometimes they would play board games in these areas. Living quarters had mattresses, pillows, and closets, along with different furniture. Latrines were generally a simple commode having small drains leading outside to a second sump pot. Bathing had places to take a bath and shower areas both with proper drainage to outside the home. The latrines and bathing platforms were located in a room attached to the outer wall. The kitchens were open-air situated in a courtyard as well as closed rooms, hearths oval, circular and rectangular in shape were also used in the house, keyhole ovens with central pillars were used for roasting meat or baking breads. Nearby might be barns or storehouses for grains and troughs to feed animals. </p>
<p>The houses varied in size and shape according to utility and class of owner. Most were single-storied with a floor of well-beaten earth and walls of mud covered with a mixture of lime, earth, and cow dung. Usually, large houses had a square courtyard surrounded by a veranda, behind which were living rooms. The more pretentious houses were built of wood with squared beams, sometimes of several stories by pillars and well provided with balconies. Different pass times around the house of playing games, working out or cooking.</p>
<p>Houses were found to be accommodated with:</p>
<p>dwelling rooms, retiring rooms, storerooms, service halls, halls with fireplaces, storehouses, closets and cloisters, halls for exercise, wells and sheds for wells, bathrooms and halls attached to bathrooms, ponds, and open-roofed sheds.</p>
<p>Common items around the house include and are not limited to:</p>
<p>Small thrones, Seats, Wicker Stands, Foot Stools, Bedsteads, Mattresses and Pillows, Bowls, Lid, Dishes, Basins, Troughs, Sieves, Storage jars, vases, Water jars.</p>
