			In the eighth year of King Devanapriya’s reign, which was the year when Kaliga was conquered,<br>
			the king ordered that one thousand copies of this edict be made.<br>
			Therefore, at this time, in the regions where Kaliga’s influence was intense,<br>
			the rules of religion and the religious teachings of King Devanapriya are diligently enforced.<br>
			In cases of death or loss, the king has decreed that the regulations and the advice of the teachers should be followed,<br>
			and also to uphold the principles of Devanapriya.<br>
			Those who serve their parents, who are attentive to their teachers, and who are praised by their friends are regarded highly.<br>
			Whether it involves killing (punishment or warfare), attachment, or decline, even if it is well-considered,<br>
			it should be done with affection and without causing undue harm.<br>
			This principle is endorsed.<br>
			In the region of Prasada, as long as Kaliga’s influence exists, and in cases of loss,<br>
			the king also decrees that either one hundred or one thousand copies of this edict should be issued according to the teacher's opinion of King Devanapriya.<br>
			The principle is to be forgiven and accepted.<br>
			In the forest, where King Devanapriya has been conquered, he still offers and praises.<br>
			In repentance, King Devanapriya also expresses regret and desires for the welfare of his people.<br>
			In victory, King Devanapriya upholds the victories of religion.<br>
			Again, where King Devanapriya has conquered, he has set boundaries of six hundred and one hundred yojanas.<br>
			(This is known as the Yona Raja's contribution.)<br>
			In the territory of Maka, named Alikasudare, with the officials of Coḍapaṃḍiya,<br>
